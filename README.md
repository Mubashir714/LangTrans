## ✨ Introduction

This project demonstrates building a machine translation model specifically designed for translating English to Urdu.  It utilizes the pre-trained models available through the Hugging Face `transformers` library and fine-tunes them on a relevant dataset.  A key aspect of this project is exploring the impact of layer freezing on the model's performance and training efficiency.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used.
*   **Hugging Face `transformers`:**  Provides access to pre-trained models and tools for NLP tasks.  [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/)
*   **Datasets:** For dataset loading and management. [https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/)
*   **Tateoba Dataset:** The dataset used for training the model.  (Add link to the dataset if available)
*   **Other Libraries:**  `torch`, `numpy`, etc. (List any other relevant libraries)

## 💾 Dataset

The model is trained using the Tateoba dataset.  (Provide more details about the dataset, its size, and any preprocessing steps if applicable).

## ⚙️ Model Training

The training process involves fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on the Tateoba dataset.  (Describe the specific model architecture used, training parameters like learning rate, batch size, etc.)

## 🥶 Layer Freezing

This project investigates the technique of layer freezing.  (Explain what layer freezing is and how it was applied in this project. Discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks).

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Example usage (replace with your actual commands)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --model_name "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ur" --dataset_path "path/to/tateoba"
python translate.py --input_text "Hello, world!"
```
